## Welcome to our Community!

This is a small blurb of text about your community of research software engineers.
You can modify it by editing `pages/index.md` in your community template.
You should be brief here, and add more substantial background in the
`pages/about.md` folder. Add information about the resources and support
you provide in `pages/support.md`, and have each member of your institution
write a page in the `_people` collections folder.
